  Each query result will be in a response map with its respective alias as the key.

  If any errors occur, an :errors key will be present with a map of each alias to its error
  information. Check for the presence of this key if detection of an error is important.

  An optional :opts key contains options, which for now is limited to:
   - meta: true or false - If false, will just report out the result as a map.
